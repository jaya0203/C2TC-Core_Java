Exception Handling:-
-----------------

default thread-main
exception:- event that disrupts the normal flow of program
-object called an excepion object, contains information about error, include it's type and state of the program when it occured.

-exception handling is one of the mechanism to handle errors
-types of errors;-( syntax, runtime,logical )

-difference btw error and exception;-
ERROR:-
-java.lang.Error package
-occurs at runtime
-eg:- java.lang.StackOverflowError, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError


Exception:-
-java.lang.Exception package
-occurs at compile time
-eg:-  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, java.lang.NullPointerException

-Whenever there's any type of error, so we can't print anything in that program when if there's exception or not.So for that we need to resolve that error, before starting of program.

Exception class hierarchy:-
---------------------------
             object
			    |
		    Throwable
          |          |
	    Error      Exception  
		
Handling Exception:-
------------------
using try-catch

try{
}
catch(exp e){
System.out.println(e);
}
